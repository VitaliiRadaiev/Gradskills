							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>7.2</span>
							<p>
								If as part of the Service Contract you have agreed any additional or replacement terms to our template service contract, then at our request, you shall provide us with details of such additional or replacement terms.

							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<span>(a)</span>
									<p>
										keep all such information secure, and not share the data with any third party, or use such data for any purpose except in relation to a Project under the terms of the Service Contract;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(b)</span>
									<p>
										take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard such personal data from unauthorised access, loss and disclosure;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(c)</span>
									<p>
										ensure that individuals processing personal data of a Freelancer are subject to a duty of confidence in relation to such personal data;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(d)</span>
									<p>
										assist us in providing subject access and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under applicable laws and assist us in meeting our legal obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches and data protection impact assessments;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<span>10.1</span>
							<p>
								All payments for Services must be made in accordance with this Condition 10, and in particular, please note that:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<span>(a)</span>
									<p>
										you need a <a href="#">Stripe</a> account to make and receive payments on the Site;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(b)</span>
									<p>
										the Client must ensure that its <a href="#">Stripe</a> Account is always in credit.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>10.2</span>
							<p>
								Payments are made according to the Milestones that are the subject of the Service Contract:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<span>(a)</span>
									<p>
										for Individual Milestones, the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee and Admin Fee is due from the Client in advance in full and the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee less the Gradskills <a href="#">Service</a> Fee is released to the Freelancer when the Client confirms that the Individual Milestone has been completed; and
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(b)</span>
									<p>
										for <a href="#">Repeating</a> Milestones, the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee and Admin Fee is due from the Client in arrears on a weekly or monthly basis, based on the cycle duration agreed between the Client and the Freelancer. The Freelancer shall submit the hours they have completed for the current cycle through the Site by midnight each Sunday for weekly cycles, and by midnight on the last Sunday of the month for monthly cycles. The Site shall then notify the Client of the details of the Project Fee and Admin Fee for this <a href="#">Repeating</a> Milestone.
										 The Client has until 5pm on the following Friday to dispute the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee.  If the Client does not dispute the Project Fee, then the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee and Admin Fee is charged to its <a href="#">Stripe</a> account and the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee less the Gradskills Service Fee is transferred to the Freelancer.  If the Client does dispute the <a href="#">Project</a> Fee, no sums are charged to its <a href="#">Stripe</a> account, and the Client should discuss the issue with the Freelancer, and then if necessary, follow the Dispute Resolution Procedure.  
									</p>
								</li>

								Payment processing services for users on Gradskills are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”).

									<p>
										set-off the negative amount of funds with funds that you subsequently receive into your <a href="#">Stripe</a> Account;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(b)</span>
									<p>
										 if you have funds in multiple currencies in your <a href="#">Stripe</a> Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency balance (at an exchange rate applied by us);

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>10.7</span>

						<li>
							<span>10.8</span>

									<p>
										we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so;
									</p>
								</li>

										we determine that a refund to the Client will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; 
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(c)</span>
									<p>
										following a determination to do so under our Dispute Resolution Procedure;
									</p>
								</li>

									<p>
										the original payment made by the Client was fraudulent;
									</p>

									<p>
										the Client has made a duplicate payment in error; or
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>(f)</span>
									<p>
										we consider, at our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund  is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.

								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>10.10</span>
							<p>
								A Freelancer can withdraw funds from their <a href="#">Stripe</a> Account subject to the following provisions:

									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>10.11</span>
							<p>
								Notwithstanding Condition 10.10 a chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that a Client files directly with their payment issuer) and a reversal instruction is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow their instructions. You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you. You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors).
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>10.12</span>
							<p>
								The Freelancer acknowledges that it shall be exclusively responsible for the payment of national insurance contributions and for the discharge of any income tax liability and VAT payable in respect of the sums paid to it and shall pay any such contributions and taxes to the appropriate authorities.  If for any reason we become liable to pay any such tax liabilities, the Freelancer shall reimburse us in an amount equal to all amounts assessed to be payable by us.

						<li>
							<span>11.1</span>

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>11.2</span>
							<p>
								In order to ensure that you have complied with Condition 11.1, we shall on reasonable notice to you be entitled to audit all payment records of a Client relating to a Freelancer that has been introduced through the Site to ensure full and accurate disclosure and payment of all sums due.  If following the audit, there is found to be a breach of Condition 11.1, then the Client shall promptly pay to us all sums that we would have retained in respect of any services provided by the Freelancer and fee paid to the Freelancer, together with the costs of the audit and enforcement of Condition 11.1.
							</p>
