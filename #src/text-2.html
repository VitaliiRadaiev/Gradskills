								All personal data that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate.  If you provide us with inaccurate or false data, and we suspect or identify fraud, we will record this and we may also report this to the appropriate authorities.

							<p>
								When you contact us by email or post, we may keep a record of the correspondence and we may also record any telephone call we have with you.

							</p>

							<p>
								We may also receive personal data about you from our third party service providers, including our platform host, WhiteLance, our payment service provider, Stripe and our analytic providers, Google.

						</li>
					</ol>

				<li>
					<h2 id="p-3"><span>3.</span>Legal basis for processing your personal data</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								We will only use your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so.  The lawful purposes that we rely on under this Privacy Policy are:

							<p>
								If you register and use the GRADSKILLS platform , we shall use your personal data in order to provide you such access in accordance with our Terms of Use.
							</p>

							<p>

							</p>

							<p>
								We may also use your personal data for our legitimate interests including:

								<li>
									<p>

							</ul>

						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>


				<li>
					<h2 id="p-4"><span>4.</span>Who do we share your data with?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Within the GRADSKILLS platform, we share personal data as follows:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										In accordance with our Terms of Use, all clients may view a freelancer’s profile and all freelancers can view a client’s profile and project descriptions.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If freelancer has agreed to provide services to a client, and a client has agreed to purchase those services, then we may share personal data between the freelancer and the client as required to ensure that the provision of the services operates in accordance with the agreed terms.  
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								For our legitimate interests, we may also share your personal data with our service providers, sub-contractors and agents that we may appoint to perform functions on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions, including IT service providers, payment providers, accountants, auditors and lawyers.    In particular, the GRADSKILLS platform is powered by WhiteLance, a trading name of Crowdskills Ltd and therefore WhiteLance will process your personal data as our processor.  WhiteLance agrees to comply with all applicable data processing laws and regulations and you should contact us if you have any questions or complaints about how Whitelance has processed your personal data.  
							</p>
							<p>
								We shall provide our service providers, sub-contractors and agents only with such of your personal data as they need to provide the service for us and if we stop using their services, we shall request that they delete your personal data or make it anonymous within their systems.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we may need to use your personal data to comply with any legal obligations, demands or requirements, for example, as part of anti-money laundering processes or to protect a third party’s rights, property, or safety then in doing so, we may share your personal data with third party authorities and regulatory organisations and agencies.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we choose to merge, sell assets, consolidate or restructure, finance, or sell all or a portion of our business by or into another company then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way that we do as set out in this Privacy Policy.
							</p>

						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>


				<li>
					<h2 id="p-5"><span>5.</span>Where we hold and process your personal data</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Some or all of your personal data may be stored or transferred outside of the United Kingdom and/or European Economic Area (the EEA) for any reason, including for example, if our email server is located in a country outside the United Kingdom  or the EEA or if any of our service providers are based outside of the United Kingdom or the EEA.
							</p>

							<p>
								Where your personal data is transferred outside the United Kingdom and/or the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for personal data or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal data – i.e., by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US-based third parties). 
							</p>
						</li>

					</ol>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h2 id="p-6"><span>6.</span>Security</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								We shall process your personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  In particular, access is restricted to employees who need to know your personal data, and we use appropriate password protection and appropriate strong encryption electronic measures within our electronic data management systems. 
							</p>
							<p>
								However, unfortunately, because of the nature of electronic storage, we cannot promise that your personal data or any other data you provide to us will always remain secure.   If there is a security breach, we will do all that we can as soon as we can to stop the breach and minimise the loss of any data.
							</p>
						</li>

					</ol>

							</p>
						</li>

									<p>
										Right to be forgotten: You also have the right at any time to require that we delete the personal data that we hold for you, where it is no longer necessary for us to hold it.

							<p>
								Where we have no legal basis for continuing to process your personal data, we shall either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
